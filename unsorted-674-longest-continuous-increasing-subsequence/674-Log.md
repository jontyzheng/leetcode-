### Question Name: 最长连续递增序列/Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

#tag# array

### Description:

 ```
 Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

 ```

### Analysis

The question is talking about how to find the longest sequence that in increasing order from an array given, for more accurate, the length of the target sequence is the final target.

And if the array given is something like {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the target length turn into 5, which is no the sequence that iterate from 0.

At first glance, I gotta say, the whole question line is clear: To iterate the array and compare the current value to the later, when it is meet the required order, record it 
and go on, only if u find the one which is cutting the whole "normal" subsequence, u gotta save the current length of "tempMax" and iterate anothe time and find the "Max".

Well, I gotta admit that the way I thought it at first time kinda draw me crazy, which means u have to use difference variable to save the length of arrays being "cut" and, compare them to find the bigger one,
which are not even to ensured that whether the number of sequence subarray would not be less than 2.
Yeah, it took me a lot time to implements it and got the RED warning from the website.

Then I turn to the comment area to find some other voice, at which I found the excellent sollution.

Before that, I have to reorganize the way to read the question.

Well, the question is about to find the longest subarray, more concrete, to find the longest length among the items showed in the array, which means the length of it is the key rather than the subarray.

In other words, as long as u get the longest length of subarray, the max of the lengths recored, u got the point, the subarray is actually not that important.

So, the crutial step is to find the lengths every time we marked as another new array, which the length of it is enough actually, then return the max of lengths, All are done!

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int max = 1;
        if (nums.length < 1){
            return 0;
        }
        int d = 0;  //  用于计算累计长度 i - d + 1, 默认下为 0, 变动时为 i
        for (int i=1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i-1]) {
                max = Math.max(i - d + 1, max); //  累计的长度, 只要后面累计的长度没有超过 max, max就一直是最大长度
            }
            else {
                d = i;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }  
}
```

Plus, I gotta say the answer who provided it first must get the hang of this question! Yeah, Firstly, he knows the method FOR will just go on whether there is something "wrong", 
keep going, u will still could record **the different values from lengths**. Secondly, he actually know how to use the expression to update the target variable, which is <I>max</I> 
in the sollution. Yeah, putting the result in the param position of the method <I>Math.max(a, b)</I>, that is awsome step. Cuz the boss will always be the boss, the max value is same. 
Only if the later lengths appearing is less than the max, the value of max will never be reaplaced and it will be the final result we want.

Another question, How he "save" the different lengths of the subarray? 
Well, in the <I>else</I> part, he just changes the value of <I>d</I>, which is part of the formula to calc the length, and it also in the if.
That amplies tha <I>else</I> is not detached from the <I>if</I> part. 
Their relationship is updating and being updated, the else part update the length that being compared, the max is the "last max".

With one word to express my emotion for that awsome solution - ultimate.
