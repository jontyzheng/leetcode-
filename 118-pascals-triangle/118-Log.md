### Description

```
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:

Input: 5
Output:
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```



### Analysis

Firstly, we gotta know what the  Pascal's triangle means. Yeah, every row is begins with 1 and also ends with 1, and from the second line on, the numbers excluding the two of them are the sum of those two numbers on the shoulder.



I mean, knowing the multi-dimension array, this question will looks straightforward and cleaner.



Because it could be viewed as numbers on a matrix. And every item's position is intuitive. We know the one on the top of the triangle is `arr[0] [0]`, then the first one at the second row is `arr[1] [0]`, and so on.



On this way, all we need to do is to combine different numbers through their positions to get the number we want.

All of it will being realized by `ArrayList`.

So here we go.



### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> generate(int numRows) {
            List<List<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>();
            int[][] arr = new int[numRows][numRows];
            for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
                List<Integer> subList = new ArrayList<>();
                for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                    if (j==0 || j==i) {
                        arr[i][j] = 1;
                    }
                    else {
                        arr[i][j] = arr[i-1][j-1]+arr[i-1][j];
                    }
                    subList.add(arr[i][j]);
                }
                list.add(subList);
            }
        return list;
    }
}
```

> The prototype is also actually a cue, which prompt us to create `List<List<Integer>>`.
